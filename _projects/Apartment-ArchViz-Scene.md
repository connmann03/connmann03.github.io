This project was my first time using Unreal Engine 4 and it was a really fun project because I got to learn the basics of lighting, placing meshes, blueprints and such. This was in an introductory course of UE4 and actually made me really like working in UE4.

The course had 3 sections you would do and the first one is learning the basics of lighting and placement by doing a Apartment Architecture Visual Scene. This part of the course taught me how to simple and some complicated post processing effects in UE4. I was able to learn how to use brushes which are geometry pieces that you can edit each face of that object. Brushes are really usefully and when I use UE4 I generally use them almost every time. Another thing I learned to use was a Sphere Reflection Capture which capture reflections in certain areas of a level. This was a simple reflection tool but another one that does reflections of the entire level is a Sky Light. I learned how to use a Post Processing Volume to change effects that the player sees. And lastly, a Light Mass Portal that basically gets a certain region in the level and where that box is intensifies the light in it so we did it with the sun to make it have more of an effect.

Another really cool tool is the Sequencer tool that can make cool cut scenes like panning throughout a room which is what exactly the course taught me. It didn't give me strict guidelines but just to experience so I did.

Here's a video of the level without camera sequencing:
