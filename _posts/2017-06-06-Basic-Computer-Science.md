Today, I experimented with Javascript, learning basic computer science concepts. I learned classes, functions, print, operation of loading, etc. And, I watched a 40 minute long lecture from MIT about introduction to computer science. It taught me more in-depth stuff about computer science basics. This course had homework that made me do Python to ask the user their birthdate and lastname then printing it.
