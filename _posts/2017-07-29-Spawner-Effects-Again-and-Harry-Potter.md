Today's work involved making a list of things I can do without help. This mostly involved spawner effects with changing colors when health depleted. I started on changing the portal's color when health depleted. After working on it for a while I couldn't figure out why it didn't work so I asked Austin. He played with it and figured out if you check the color and if their alpha is enabled it works. For some at least. Next, I discovered it had to do with the amount of exposure of that color. If you lower it, it would change colors. It was canceling out the dynamic change to red.

Before that we went and saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
