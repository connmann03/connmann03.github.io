Today, we didn't do any work, but instead we decided to go to the museums in D.C. We first ate at Roti in Rosslyn. Which took about 30 mins and it was already 3 p.m, and most of the museums close at 5 p.m. So, we went back to the apartment and then rode metro to the museum since if we drove into D.C. it would've taken an hour. It took 30ish minutes riding metro on blue line. 

We arrived at our final stop which was the Smithsonian Station. We, Austin and I, exited paying little over $4 for 2.5 miles of train tracks. We walked a few blocks over to the Freer & Sackler Gallery. There was a exhibit we wanted to see about a mysterious artist named Kitagawa Utamaro. His works were prints with lots of overlaping of different layers and designs. He reused designs from books in his works.

It was a really good exhibit, but it closed right after we saw everything so we went to see if the other museums were closed and they closed right after we arrived there too. So, we ate/got a drink and rode metro back.
