  The artist behind many Billboard Hot 100 “works of art”, such as his many classics “Magnolia”(2017), “Wokeuplikethis”, “Shoota”(2018), and many more. “Magnolia” was truly his first breakout single that revealed to the public eye who this Playboi Carti person was. His hit single mentioned a popular dance move called the Milly Rock. Playboi Carti says, “In New York I Milly Rock,” referring to this dance move. A month later, popular Youtube influencer Roy Purdy uploaded a video to his Youtube channel doing the Milly Rock in New York to Playboi Carti’s “Magnolia” song. This video blew up with millions of views and people started sharing the song globally. Playboi Carti was now known in the “public eye.” This one song prospered his professional career, but years before there were other various hit singles that caused a rush of fans like the “Magnolia Effect.” One said hit single that privately exploded his career was “Broke Boi.”
