Today's work involved just adding some more features to the stealth style game. I first added the phone game to have more a meaning and a particle effect that plays after every 50 points. Later it will have multipliers and stuff. But the image changes after every 50 and the guy dances. And it's random to get a Soulja boy.

After that I added a new cover pickup actor that the player can disguise themself as a plant. Pressing E to pick it up and then E to drop it.

After that, I then added a toilet paper roll that you can throw and maybe some day will paint the ground with decals. Then, I made a visibility meter to light.
