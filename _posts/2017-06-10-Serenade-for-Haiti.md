Today, Austin, Stephanie, and I went to see a movie that was a part of the Caribbean Film Festival at American Film Institute Silver Spring. We saw *Serenade for Haiti*, a movie about the evolution of a music school called Sainte Trinit√© Music School. Their website is 
[Serenade for Haiti](https://www.serenadeforhaiti.com/). The theater was an old theater that looked awesome from the inside. After, we went duckpin bowling and it was better than regular bowling. Then I got to do my own laundry, yay?!
