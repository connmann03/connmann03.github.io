Today's work involved adding functionality for the toilet paper by making it give points when it collides with a tree and then spawns a plane like streamer on the location, later it will replaced with a cloth piece. After that I started working on a spray paint can and it looks really neat. I looked into how to do spray paint and it is cool because it uses render targets just like the camera screens
