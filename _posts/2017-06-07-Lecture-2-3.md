Today's work involved watching lecture 2 of MIT's Introduction to Computer Science which involved homework where I had to write a program which took in the user's outstanding balance on their credit card, their annual credit card interest rate, and minimum monthly payment rate. When they inserted those float values, the program would find the minimum monthly payment each month, the principle pay, and the remaining balance for each month then the remaining balance of the year. And the total amount paid. This homework was harder than yesterday's so I watched lecture 3 like it said to get extra knowledge on while and for loops. This aided me in finishing two of the problems with slight help with the math from my brother, Adam.
