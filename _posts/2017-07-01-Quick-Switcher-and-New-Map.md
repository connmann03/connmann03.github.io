Today's work involved finishing the quick switcher logic and creating a new map of some sorts. Today, Austin came over to my desk again and started breaking apart the quick switcher code and re-wiring it. He started doing this while I finished watching Lord of The Rings. Austin got the switcher to scroll throughout the items coloring the magic type to a different color, purple in this instance, but it wouldn't select the magic type through our blueprint structure, which holds our particles, animations, type, icon, etc. Then, he hooked up the struct and got it working.

After that, he took a break to do his own work I worked on a island map with a river that flows from the ocean, estuary. I'm still working on it so it looks bad which is why I don't have pictures.
