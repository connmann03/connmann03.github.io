Today's work involved making a multi-spawner structure that would come from the sky and slam on the ground resembling a castle. This castle would have multiple portals in it that you would have to destroy individually to destroy the entire structure. I started making a castle with 2 pillars and a main base that had a door on it.

Then I started making this bigger castle that had multiple archways for the spawners.

After I did that I added a mana meter that gradually increases by game time, but doesn't get affected by the mana pickups (yet).
