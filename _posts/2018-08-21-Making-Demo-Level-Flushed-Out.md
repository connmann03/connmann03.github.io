Today's work involved me after school adding in hills and stuff in the demo map to make the sneaker players to use their abilities like their mirror, the placing the phone on camera, etc. I made hills that there's only one way around them and that's in front of a camera, forcing the player to place their phone on the camera. I also made a sort of bridge over the small pond, I should make the pond a lake since it's quite small, but it is alright for now.
