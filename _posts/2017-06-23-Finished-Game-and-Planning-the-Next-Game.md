excerpt: "Today's work was completing the entire Udemy course which involved finishing the survival game I started."

Things I learned today:

- Playing UI Animations given an event
- Blending two camera positions on event
- Packaging my game to share

Today I finished my 3 videos left in my Udemy course which included; wave notifications, death camera (blending camera), and packaging my build. The way we did wave notifications is right before the wave spawns, it prints out on the screen via a UI Widget saying "Wave Completed" then spawns the next wave. And the death camera is just a camera on the map that blends between another one on the screen after you beat the game or lose. After that, we packaged the build into the /Documents/ folder and it has an .exe file which is the game.

After that, Adam, Austin, and I planned the game Adam and I are making together based on the games we have made so far. We came up with ideas for pinball games with elements from all the games we created, but one stood out from the rest. That one that stood out, was called "Horde Refined" where we take this survival game and add more elements to it like different enemies, bosses, better camera, better notifications, more levels, more weapons, better powerups, and more crazy stuff. And we're thinking of refining this game later on into a hack'n'slash.

I am starting this game refinement tomorrow and Austin and Adam are planning our trip to Japan on the 4th.

	Things Adam and I Can Do After
