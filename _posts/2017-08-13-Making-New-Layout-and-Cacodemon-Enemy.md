Today's work involved roughing out the layout and how the level will play out by adding text that describes what will go on in this level. I first went through the level and was only doing the beginning entrance then Austin told me to go on and do the rest. I did it in an hour after that. Adding text, describing what will be changed and how this room will play out. He then went through and did the same.

{% include image.html filename="edits.PNG" description="How we noted edits in 3D space" %}

{% include image.html filename="texts.png" description="Another shot of edit notes in the level" %}

I then made a trap that when you walk in the trigger box, it slams two doors down on the ground behind you and plays a cinematic showing the spawner and the doors closing behind you.

Next, Austin started carving in a new concept where the player has to navigate the lava on a floating block, then jump over and defeat some enemies. But, you could also jump back on the platform that's floating and move back to safety.

Then, I started adding new things like an openable door by pressing E and then an invisible wall that's can only be walked through one way and not the other. Next, we changed the layout of the entire map.

{% include image.html filename="door.png" description="Door" %}
{% include image.html filename="invisiblewall.png" description="Invisible Wall" %}
{% include image.html filename="newchanges.png" description="New Changes to Level" %}

After that, I started on making a Cacodemon (from Doom) type enemy that the projectiles it fires shoot towards you and don't have gravity.
