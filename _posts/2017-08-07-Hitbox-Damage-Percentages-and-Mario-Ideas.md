Today's work involved doing different percentages of the damage of the projectile for each body section. And then making left click stage 1 attack and right click stage 2. I started doing the percentages work and I ended up doing pretty well. I figured it out on my own after figuring out how to get the damage from the projectile. Then, I made left click stage one by making the projectile shoot stage 1 and stage 2 for right click.

After the two challenges of the day, I added another attack to the attack array which was the sword. We had the idea that one "attack" would have everything about it in there. The projectile/item (sword or even like throwing a pot), the montage, tile, and much more. But we have to think more. 

I then played Super Mario 3D World for Wii U to figure out character ideas and I liked the hammer bros that throw hammers (or fire) at you and jump around only. Then I liked this dinosaur you had to ride through the water with. I also like how there are moving platforms, challenges, and more.
