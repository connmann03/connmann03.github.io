Today's work involved me working on how the level is layed out and fixing the dark lighting on my computer. I figured it's because of my AMD graphics card and my brother does too. I added a shed that maybe the sneakers get their sabotage items there like spray paint cans and maybe a lawn mower.

I made the shed have a shelf and not shiny materials and fixed the lighting to be so dark, I just bumped the exposure.
