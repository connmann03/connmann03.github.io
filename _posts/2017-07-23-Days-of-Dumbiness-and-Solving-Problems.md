Today's work involved solving our two day long problem of not being able to make the character move. After hours of trying several things; duplicating the troll, replacing the troll mesh with a worm, and many more dumb things; we figured it out. Austin had the idea that if every thing is broken, maybe it's that spawner. And it was. It was my dumb butt not putting the nav mesh. Like how dumb could I be it's so bad. But, we have a flying(ish) enemy that spits acid at you and it's super scary since the enemy is a worm that flies.

Here's the end result.
