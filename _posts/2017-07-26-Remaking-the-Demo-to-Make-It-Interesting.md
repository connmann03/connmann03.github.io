Today's work involved making a serpentine type room that you had to fight your way through the little hallways to get through the room. Before that we played Hyrule Warriors to look how the attacks take place in the combat system. Their combat had 2 different regular attack buttons but after each press there was a different animation and if you mix and match those button presses you can do cool combos. Then there is a super where you have full potion meter. We played this for about an hour but it was fun.

After that, I started the map and mid-way through, Austin fixed the bugs with the spawner. Then I came up with this:

{% include image.html filename="gate.png" description="Gate Preventing You From Advancing" %}
{% include image.html filename="gateroom.png" description="Inside Gate Room With Two Spawners" %}
{% include image.html filename="wormroom.png" description="Worm Room" %}
{% include image.html filename="bigarea.png" description="Big Area Overhead View" %}
