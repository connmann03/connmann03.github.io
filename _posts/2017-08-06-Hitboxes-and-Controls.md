Today's work involved making a hitbox for the troll since we think the game will be much more fun if you add hitboxes so when you hit the enemy in the head it will inflict more damage. I started added a hitbox to the troll and this is what I ended up with.

Next, we started messing with double jumping, faster movement for the player, higher jumper, and more.

I'm dumb and don't like percents.
