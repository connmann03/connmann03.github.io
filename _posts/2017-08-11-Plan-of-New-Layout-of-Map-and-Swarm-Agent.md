Today's work involved figuring out what we want the level to play out and making swarm agent (the rendering program for the Unreal Engine 4 building process of lighting, etc) work with the other computers in the household so it can render faster. After almost two hours of messing with the swarm agent settings, it finally worked. After that I worked on making the first floor and planning out how the entire map will play out. I made a entrance with a gate and it's becoming a castle.
