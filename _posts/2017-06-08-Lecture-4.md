Today's work involved continuing the lectures of MITs Introduction to Computer Science and the recursions. The recursions greatly helped me continue the lectures since it explained the concepts better in a shorter time than the 2-3 lectures. The lectures I watched was 3 and 4 which involved learning some of these main ideas; tuples, decomposition, abstraction, and functions.
