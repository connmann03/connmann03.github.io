Today, I watched lecture 5 of Introduction to Computer Science by MIT OpenCourseWare. It involved learning objects in python. I learned slicing, lists, more on tuples, appending to lists/tuples, methods, dictionaries, and more. But, the appending and dictionaries was the main things. I learned that lists are mutable and that tuples are not mutable. We then went to eat at Crystal City.
