Today's work involved making a neighborhood and finishing the level almost. I started making more houses with fences around them and grass beneath them, but Austin insisted I don't make all of the land flat so I added a slope. I added road and tweaked an existing material to look like asphalt. The asphalt was a decent material and then I quickly drew up a road stripe and put it as a decal onto the road. I then made a small store model in Blender and implemented it into the community. Next, I made a parking line decal inside Gimp and put it on the road model again. After that I saw that going up hill, the mower wouldn't rotate to the incline, so I implemented where it would detect the angle and force the rotation to be that of the ramp.
