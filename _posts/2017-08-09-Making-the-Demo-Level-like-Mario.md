Today's work involved using the moving platforms I created and combining it with my serpentine style room into a better demo level. I created a starting area to get the player used to the moving platforms. It consists of two of the platforms moving in a circular pattern on different times so it can be harder. From that higher one you have to wait and leap onto a smaller platform that drops you off over the wall into the fighting area. Next I created a moving platform in the next room that will dip down beneath the level.
