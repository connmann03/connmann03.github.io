Hey yeah um...my name's Conner (with an "e") and I make games! I don't do it all the time, I am actually very lazy in fact and so I barely work on games but when I do I make some pretty cool stuff! I also am a pretty cool person and not just a couch potato...I like to socialize and I try to socialize a lot, but if it is meeting new people, I am very bad at doing that. But after a while I am not so awkward. I am very good at math and love anything to do with computer science or I guess "technology." That is a very broad topic but maybe electronics. I have short blonde hair and blue eyes. I think I have an addiction to buying shoes and having good fashion sense. I'm a very boring person but I act cool so yeahhh.
